    Solver instance is now created in :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.NumPyMinimumEigensolverFactory`,
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUCCFactory` and :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUVCCFactory`
    constructors instead of get_solver method.
    Setters for properties are deprecated and the solver instance has to be used instead.
