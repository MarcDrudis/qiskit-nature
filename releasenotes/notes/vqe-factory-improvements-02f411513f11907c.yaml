    The factories had setter/getter properties that set/get the corresponding property of the solver (VQE).
    These are now deprecated and require you to set/get properties on the solver directly, which can now be
    accessed via a new `minimum_eigensolver` attribute. Several explicitly named constructor properties that
    went directly into the solver are deprecated too, in terms of being able to be used as a positional argument
    - if you were using them as keyword arguments then they continue to work via the kwargs that is the mechanism
    by which the solver construction can now be tailored.
